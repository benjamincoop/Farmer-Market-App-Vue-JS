# Setup
This project uses quite a few dependencies that the developer will have to install.
First, ensure that npm is installed. Running `npm install` will install all required
dependencies.

# Development
We have installed `webpack-dev-server` so you can either run either `npm run serve`
or `webpack-dev-server --mode development` to start a reactive development server
at `127.0.0.1:8080`.

Similarly, you can create the build by running `npm run build`. This also has the
effect of updating the github pages website, although it may take up to 10 minutes
to load.
